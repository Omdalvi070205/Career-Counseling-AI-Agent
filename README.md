# Career-Counseling-AI-Agent

## Agentic Career Counseling Companion ðŸ¤–
An intelligent, autonomous agent designed to provide personalized and adaptive career guidance. This system continuously monitors student performance, evolving interests, and real-time labor market trends to deliver tailored career pathway suggestions, empowering students to make confident, future-ready decisions.

This project was developed as part of an IBM Internship Program.

## The Problem ðŸ˜Ÿ
Students often struggle to make informed career decisions due to several key factors:

Fragmented Guidance: Access to quality career counseling is often inconsistent and not personalized.

Limited Self-Awareness: Students may not fully recognize their academic strengths or how their interests align with potential careers.

Evolving Industries: The rapid pace of technological and economic change makes it difficult to track in-demand skills and future-proof career paths.

Traditional counseling methods lack the personalization and scalability to address these challenges effectively, leading to career mismatches and missed opportunities.

## Our Solution âœ¨
The Agentic Career Counseling Companion is an intelligent, autonomous agent that acts as a personal career advisor for every student. It addresses the core problem by:

Continuously monitoring student academic performance, project work, and evolving interests.

Analyzing real-time labor market trends, including in-demand skills, job growth areas, and salary expectations.

Delivering tailored career pathway suggestions that bridge the gap between a student's profile and industry needs.

This empowers students to make proactive, data-driven decisions with minimal dependency on manual intervention, ensuring the guidance is both scalable and deeply personalized.
